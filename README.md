# SelfCity Unity - City Building Game

A Unity-based city-building game that helps you build healthy real-life habits while constructing your dream city.

## 🎮 Game Overview
SelfCity is a 2D city-building game where players construct and manage their own city while also building healthy habits in real life. The quest system is inspired by real-world wellness, creativity, social, and health activities, encouraging players to take positive actions each day. The game features an intuitive UI system with drag-and-drop functionality, daily quests, a custom quest system, a comprehensive building system, and a complete authentication and subscription system.

## ✨ Features

* **🏗️ City Building System** – Place and manage various building types
* **🌆 City Region Zoom & Edit Mode** – Click a region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, Creative Commons) to smoothly zoom in. In edit mode, a grid overlay appears, and you can drag buildings from your inventory onto the grid. The inventory panel hides during drag and reappears after drop for a clean user experience.
* **📦 Inventory & Shop System**  
   * Decorations and buildings won from chests or purchased from the shop are stored in a persistent inventory  
   * Flexible shop UI for region-specific buildings and currencies  
   * **Drag-and-drop from inventory to city grid** – Placing an item removes it from inventory and places it on the grid. Clicking a placed item removes it from the grid and returns it to your inventory, fully supporting sorting and filtering.
* **📋 Quest & Habit System**  
   * **Static Region Quests**: Each region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, Creative Commons) has its own unique set of static quests, all inspired by healthy habits (physical, mental, social, and creative wellness).  
   * **Daily Quests**: A separate pool of daily quests is generated every 24 hours, with each quest tagged by its region and based on real-life healthy activities.  
   * **Custom Tasks**: Players can create their own custom quests, assign them to a region, and add them to their To-Do list via a dedicated modal window—perfect for tracking your own healthy habits.
* **💰 Resource Management**  
   * Completing quests rewards you with the correct region-based currency (crystals, hearts, magical, stars, etc.).  
   * **Dynamic Rewards:** The reward amount and icon are parsed directly from the quest string (e.g., "+5"), and are displayed and rewarded dynamically in all quest and To-Do list UIs.
* **🎯 Interactive UI**  
   * Modern, responsive user interface with modal windows for quests, custom tasks, and chest opening confirmations  
   * Confirmation modal prevents accidental spending of tickets when opening chests  
   * All quest lists and the To-Do list display both the reward amount and the correct resource icon for each quest.
* **📱 Drag & Drop** – Intuitive building placement system with inventory integration and grid snapping.
* **🎨 Visual Assets** – Rich collection of sprites and visual elements

## DecorationNames.txt Structure (for Collaborating Developers)

The `Assets/Resources/DecorationNames.txt` file is used to mass-populate the CityBuilder's Building Types list via the CityBuilder auto-populate editor script. The file is structured as follows:

- **Lines 1–307:** Normal Decorations (for free AND premium players)
- **Lines 308–417:** Premium Decorations (for premium players only)
- **Lines 418–437:** Health Harbor Buildings
- **Lines 438–457:** Mind Palace Buildings
- **Lines 458–477:** Creative Commons Buildings
- **Lines 478–497:** Social Square Buildings

### How to Use
1. Select the CityBuilder GameObject in the Unity Hierarchy.
2. In the Inspector, use the "Populate from Name List (.txt)" button (provided by the CityBuilderAutoPopulateEditor script).
3. Select `DecorationNames.txt` when prompted.
4. The Building Types list will be filled in the above order.
5. Assign the correct prefab and sprite for each entry as needed.

**Note:**
- The order of items in the .txt file is important for distinguishing between normal decorations, premium decorations, and buildings by region.
- When adding new items, maintain this order for consistency.
