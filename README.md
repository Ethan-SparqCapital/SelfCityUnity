# SelfCity Unity - City Building Game

A Unity-based city-building game that helps you build healthy real-life habits while constructing your dream city.

## 🎮 Game Overview

SelfCity is a 2D city-building game where players construct and manage their own city while also building healthy habits in real life. The quest system is inspired by real-world wellness, creativity, social, and health activities, encouraging players to take positive actions each day. The game features an intuitive UI system with drag-and-drop functionality, daily quests, a custom quest system, and a comprehensive building system.

## ✨ Features

- **🏗️ City Building System** - Place and manage various building types
- **📋 Quest & Habit System**
  - **Static Region Quests**: Each region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, Creative Commons) has its own unique set of static quests, all inspired by healthy habits (physical, mental, social, and creative wellness).
  - **Daily Quests**: A separate pool of daily quests is generated every 24 hours, with each quest tagged by its region and based on real-life healthy activities.
  - **Custom Tasks**: Players can create their own custom quests, assign them to a region, and add them to their To-Do list via a dedicated modal window—perfect for tracking your own healthy habits.
- **💰 Resource Management**
  - Completing quests rewards you with the correct region-based currency (crystals, hearts, magical, stars, etc.).
  - **Dynamic Rewards:** The reward amount and icon are parsed directly from the quest string (e.g., "+5"), and are displayed and rewarded dynamically in all quest and To-Do list UIs.
- **🎯 Interactive UI**
  - Modern, responsive user interface with modal windows for quests and custom tasks
  - All quest lists and the To-Do list display both the reward amount and the correct resource icon for each quest.
- **📱 Drag & Drop** - Intuitive building placement system
- **🎨 Visual Assets** - Rich collection of sprites and visual elements
- **🔧 Modular Architecture** - Well-structured codebase for easy expansion

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP) - will be auto-installed

### Installation
1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   - You can clone the repository or download and unzip the project folder.
   - To zip your project for sharing, include only the following folders:
     - `Assets/`
     - `Packages/`
     - `ProjectSettings/`
     - (optionally) `UserSettings/`
   - Do **not** include `Library/`, `Temp/`, or `Logs/` folders.

2. **Open in Unity Hub**
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click "Open" and select the project folder
   - Wait for Unity to import and install packages

3. **Open the main scene**
   - Navigate to `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`
   - Press Play to start the game

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Build Your City** - Use the building menu to place structures and grow your city.
2. **Complete Quests**
   - **Region Quests**: Click a region button to view and add static quests to your To-Do list. Each quest is inspired by a real-life healthy habit (e.g., exercise, mindfulness, social connection, creativity).
   - **Daily Quests**: Open the Daily Quests modal to view a set of daily quests (refreshes every 24 hours), each encouraging a positive real-world action.
   - **Custom Tasks**: Click "Add Custom Task" to open a modal where you can create your own healthy habits, assign them to a region, and add them to your To-Do list.
3. **Earn Rewards**
   - Completing quests in the To-Do list gives you the correct region-based currency and amount, as shown in the UI.
4. **Expand Districts** - Unlock new areas as you progress

## 📝 Custom Tasks Feature

- Click the **Add Custom Task** button to open the custom quest modal.
- Enter your custom activity and select a region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, or Creative Commons).
- Your custom quest will appear in the modal's list, with an "Add To-Do" button next to it.
- You can add any custom quest to your To-Do list, and completing it will reward you with the correct region currency and amount.

## 🔄 Daily Quest Refresh Logic
- Daily quests are generated from a separate pool and are tagged by region.
- The list of daily quests automatically refreshes with new quests every 24 hours.
- The region label at the end of each quest ensures the correct reward is given.

## 🧩 Dynamic Rewards System
- The reward amount and icon for each quest are parsed from the quest string (e.g., "+5").
- Changing the reward in the quest string automatically updates the UI and the actual reward given to the player.
- **Anyone who downloads this repository and opens it in Unity will see the exact same UI, quest system, and dynamic rewards as the project author.**
