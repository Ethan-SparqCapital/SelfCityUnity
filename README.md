# SelfCity Unity - City Building Game

A Unity-based city-building game that helps you build healthy real-life habits while constructing your dream city.

## 🎮 Game Overview
SelfCity is a 2D city-building game where players construct and manage their own city while also building healthy habits in real life. The quest system is inspired by real-world wellness, creativity, social, and health activities, encouraging players to take positive actions each day. The game features an intuitive UI system with drag-and-drop functionality, daily quests, a custom quest system, and a comprehensive building system.

## ✨ Features

* **🏗️ City Building System** – Place and manage various building types
* **🌆 City Region Zoom & Edit Mode** – Click a region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, Creative Commons) to smoothly zoom in. In edit mode, a grid overlay appears, and you can drag buildings from your inventory onto the grid. The inventory panel hides during drag and reappears after drop for a clean user experience.
* **📦 Inventory & Shop System**  
   * Decorations and buildings won from chests or purchased from the shop are stored in a persistent inventory  
   * Flexible shop UI for region-specific buildings and currencies  
   * **Drag-and-drop from inventory to city grid** – Placing an item removes it from inventory and places it on the grid. Clicking a placed item removes it from the grid and returns it to your inventory, fully supporting sorting and filtering.
* **📋 Quest & Habit System**  
   * **Static Region Quests**: Each region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, Creative Commons) has its own unique set of static quests, all inspired by healthy habits (physical, mental, social, and creative wellness).  
   * **Daily Quests**: A separate pool of daily quests is generated every 24 hours, with each quest tagged by its region and based on real-life healthy activities.  
   * **Custom Tasks**: Players can create their own custom quests, assign them to a region, and add them to their To-Do list via a dedicated modal window—perfect for tracking your own healthy habits.
* **💰 Resource Management**  
   * Completing quests rewards you with the correct region-based currency (crystals, hearts, magical, stars, etc.).  
   * **Dynamic Rewards:** The reward amount and icon are parsed directly from the quest string (e.g., "+5"), and are displayed and rewarded dynamically in all quest and To-Do list UIs.
* **🎯 Interactive UI**  
   * Modern, responsive user interface with modal windows for quests, custom tasks, and chest opening confirmations  
   * Confirmation modal prevents accidental spending of tickets when opening chests  
   * All quest lists and the To-Do list display both the reward amount and the correct resource icon for each quest.
* **📱 Drag & Drop** – Intuitive building placement system with inventory integration and grid snapping.
* **🎨 Visual Assets** – Rich collection of sprites and visual elements
* **🔧 Modular Architecture** – Well-structured codebase for easy expansion

## 🛠️ Technical Details

* **Engine:** Unity 2022.3 LTS (or newer)
* **Render Pipeline:** Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
* **Input System:** Unity's new Input System
* **UI Framework:** Unity UI with TextMesh Pro

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer
* Universal Render Pipeline (URP) - will be auto-installed

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Project**  
   * You can clone the repository or download and unzip the project folder.  
   * To zip your project for sharing, include only the following folders:  
         * `Assets/`  
         * `Packages/`  
         * `ProjectSettings/`  
         * (optionally) `UserSettings/`  
   * Do **not** include `Library/`, `Temp/`, or `Logs/` folders.
2. **Open in Unity Hub**  
   * Launch Unity Hub  
   * Click "Open" and select the project folder  
   * Wait for Unity to import and install packages
3. **Open the main scene**  
   * Navigate to `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`  
   * Press Play to start the game

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Build Your City** – Use the building menu to place structures and grow your city.
2. **Zoom and Edit Regions** – Click a region to zoom in. Enter edit mode to see a grid overlay and drag items from your inventory onto the grid. The inventory panel hides while dragging and reappears after drop.
3. **Complete Quests**  
   * **Region Quests**: Click a region button to view and add static quests to your To-Do list. Each quest is inspired by a real-life healthy habit (e.g., exercise, mindfulness, social connection, creativity).  
   * **Daily Quests**: Open the Daily Quests modal to view a set of daily quests (refreshes every 24 hours), each encouraging a positive real-world action.  
   * **Custom Tasks**: Click "Add Custom Task" to open a modal where you can create your own healthy habits, assign them to a region, and add them to your To-Do list.
4. **Earn Rewards**  
   * Completing quests in the To-Do list gives you the correct region-based currency and amount, as shown in the UI.
5. **Open Chests with Confirmation**  
   * When opening a Decor Chest or Premium Decor Chest, a confirmation modal appears to prevent accidental spending of Balance Tickets. Confirm to open and receive a random reward, which is added to your inventory.
6. **Manage Your Inventory**  
   * All decorations and buildings you win or purchase are stored in your inventory. Use the inventory UI to view, filter, and drag items into your city. Placing an item removes it from inventory; clicking a placed item on the grid returns it to your inventory, supporting all filters and sorting.
7. **Expand Districts** – Unlock new areas as you progress

## 📝 Custom Tasks Feature

* Click the **Add Custom Task** button to open the custom quest modal.
* Enter your custom activity and select a region (Health Harbor, Mind Palace, Social Square, or Creative Commons).
* Your custom quest will appear in the modal's list, with an "Add To-Do" button next to it.
* You can add any custom quest to your To-Do list, and completing it will reward you with the correct region currency and amount.

## 🔄 Daily Quest Refresh Logic

* Daily quests are generated from a separate pool and are tagged by region.
* The list of daily quests automatically refreshes with new quests every 24 hours.
* The region label at the end of each quest ensures the correct reward is given.

## 🧩 Dynamic Rewards System

* The reward amount and icon for each quest are parsed from the quest string (e.g., "+5").
* Changing the reward in the quest string automatically updates the UI and the actual reward given to the player.
* **Anyone who downloads this repository and opens it in Unity will see the exact same UI, quest system, and dynamic rewards as the project author.**

**Built with ❤️ using Unity** 

## DecorationNames.txt Structure (for Collaborating Developers)

The `Assets/Resources/DecorationNames.txt` file is used to mass-populate the CityBuilder's Building Types list via the CityBuilder auto-populate editor script. The file is structured as follows:

- **Lines 1–307:** Normal Decorations (for free AND premium players)
- **Lines 308–417:** Premium Decorations (for premium players only)
- **Lines 418–437:** Health Harbor Buildings
- **Lines 438–457:** Mind Palace Buildings
- **Lines 458–477:** Creative Commons Buildings
- **Lines 478–497:** Social Square Buildings

### How to Use
1. Select the CityBuilder GameObject in the Unity Hierarchy.
2. In the Inspector, use the "Populate from Name List (.txt)" button (provided by the CityBuilderAutoPopulateEditor script).
3. Select `DecorationNames.txt` when prompted.
4. The Building Types list will be filled in the above order.
5. Assign the correct prefab and sprite for each entry as needed.

**Note:**
- The order of items in the .txt file is important for distinguishing between normal decorations, premium decorations, and buildings by region.
- When adding new items, maintain this order for consistency.
